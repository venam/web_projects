#Canvas City Website

This is a projet website about a virtual city that is run by people made by Canvas.<br>
I didn't really mess with canvas before this project and it was the occasion to explore the **monster** that everyone was talking about<br>
I'm pretty glad about the result of my work, nonetheless the fonts are messed up and too heavy for real production.<br>
